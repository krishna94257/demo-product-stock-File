	* FreeSerif.sfd,

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: regarding
	  horizontal spacing, on advice of Zdenek. o, au -- stems were too
	  close. danda, dbldanda: much too near preceding word. Made so
	  that danda-space would space the mark evenly between the words.
	  Made lookups for similarly-spaced question and exclamation marks.
	  Kerning (or dist?): Experiments -- problems include: Firefox
	  doesn't seem to support "dist". Xetex doesn't turn kerning on by
	  default. Fontforge complains Windows doesn't like to kern
	  auxiliaries with Unicode ranges. Nonetheless, it does pack words
	  rather tighter. My own advice: made ra glyph more narrow. It was
	  the worst, spacing wise, on the un-kerned page. Oriya: made
	  similar spacing for its danda.

2012-03-23 12:56 +0000 [r2174]  Stevan_White:

	* FreeSerif.sfd,
	  FreeSerifBold.sfd: Devanagari: efforts to
	  improve horizontal spacing, that Zdenek complains about. 1)
	  medium: o, au vowels: stems too close 2) danda, dbldanda, should
	  be widely separated from words, centred between them. 3) bold: on
	  horizontal, bevels extend rather more than they should (reduced
	  in Unicode and through first set of half marks in the
	  auxiliaries... willl complete later.) 4) made special localized
	  forms of question, exclamation mark.

	  this to PSNames:Weight --? so changed that.) Experimenting with
	  General:Name For Humans (Fiddled with Family Name too...but
	  changed it back.) Changes to OS/2:Sub/Super Subscript Offset --
	  made positive. Some fiddling with Panose info. Also: previously
	  OS/2 Charsets missed 708, Arabic ASMO 708. (Bug in
	  FontForge-patch reported.) In sans and mono oblique, bold, and
	  boldoblique, added some math operators to fill an Apple codepage.
	  Sinhala: FreeSerifBold -- implemented same change moving 'ccmp'
	  to 'akhn' as in roman face. Has to do with bug in OpenOffice/ICU.
